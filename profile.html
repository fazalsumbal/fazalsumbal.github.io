              <p>
             I am intented to learn the HTML and CSS to be able to  build the basic simple website. Then like to extend my expertise to JavaScript and PHP to get a more deeper insight of web development. I am also interested to explore the how all these languages work together to make a sphosticated webpage.

             Furthermore, My focus is also that my creative side towards web development enhanced as well. Alongside, I am also interested to learn the <em>German workforce system</em> and their working style, how all these work.
